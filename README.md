# SeniorDesign
The location of all code for our robot


The folders are split up as follows:
- Networking code (communication between the controller and the Arduino's, Pi to Arduino, and Pi to app)
- Drivetrain (probably all Arduino sketches regarding the movement of the robot)
- Vision (all detection and CV code/algorithms, probably Pi code)
- Targeting (all of the gun movement and firing)

These are subject to change as the project evolves, but this document should always be updated to reflect the change in structure.
